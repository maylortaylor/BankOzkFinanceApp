# Assignment
The assignment is to create an application that allows users to manage savings goals and to save money towards
them. You can choose to create a mobile app or a web app. Your app should consist of a client
application and a back-end REST API. The goal is to create a product. It should not be polished.

## Required Features
The following functionality must be present:

- Users should be able to register and log in into the app using one of the following accounts:
Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft, GitHub. Only one log in method is needed.

- The app should have a simple UI to view, create, update and delete saving goals. Each goal should
have name, target amount (how much you want to save) and amount currently saved.

- Users should be able to save towards their goals and to see their progress. While you donâ€™t need
to integrate with any payments API and actually transfer money, they UI should allow users to
save towards the goal and to see the goal progress.

## Bonus Points
The following is not required, but is nice to have. You would get bonus points if you:

- Deploy application to the cloud
- Setup continuous integration
- Use VueJS for your front-end
- Use .NET Core for your back-end API
- Use Azure to host your application

## Technical Requirements
You can use any technology as long as your application has:
- Single Page Application (SPA) front-end that uses components and one of the modern JS
frameworks. You can use any technology if you decide to write a mobile app instead.
- RESTful API back-end.
